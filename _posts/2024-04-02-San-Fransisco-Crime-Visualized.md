# INTRODUCTION – CRIME IN SAN FRNACISCO 

Welcome to our in-depth analysis of San Francisco property crimes.
Within our dataset spanning from 2010 to 2017 (right?), we narrow our scope to investigate the dynamics of property crimes and their impact on community safet.
Our analysis aims to disentangle the complex patterns and trends surrounding property-related criminal activities in the city, with a particular focus on understanding thefts, burglaries, vandalism, and related offenses.
We can provide a more focused analysis of variables like location, time of occurrence, and seasonal variations by focusing only on property crimes, which can provide important insights into the underlying causes of these offenses.
Our analysis aims to provide actionable intelligence to support law enforcement, policymakers, and community stakeholders in addressing and mitigating property-related crime in San Francisco.
This includes identifying high-risk areas and investigating temporal trends.

When looking at crime statistics over time, a pattern becomes apparent that seems to be getting stronger, especially in the second half of the year. There is a clear trend: the first few months of the year are comparatively quiet, while the second half of the year records high activity.

It is noteworthy that, in the examined period, the years 2012 and 2017 are the most peaceful.
This research emphasises how changing socioeconomic and environmental factors can cause crime trends to fluctuate over time.

In examining crime patterns in San Francisco, we observe that areas closer to the coast often exhibit higher rates of criminal activity, even because the proximity to major ports provide an easy access for exporting stolen vehicles.

However, it's crucial to approach this observation with nuance. While proximity to the coast may be a contributing factor, it's just one piece of the puzzle in understanding community safety.

In San Francisco, areas such as the Tenderloin, the Mission District, and parts of the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood have historically been associated with higher crime rates. These areas often face challenges related to poverty, homelessness, drug activity, and other socio-economic factors that can contribute to crime.

On the other hand, areas with lower crime rates might gain from elements like greater incomes, more active local communities, and more funding for public (and possibly even private) safety measures.

Furthermore, persistent initiatives to combat crime and enhance safety by local government, law enforcement, and community organizations may eventually cause changes in crime trends.

we present an interactive plot illustrating the occurrences of various crime types throughout the day. Notably, a consistent trend emerges across different crime categories: an uptick in incidents typically occurs from 5 pm until 4 am.

Specifically, crimes such as vehicle theft and larceny/theft show peaks during these hours. However, it's essential to note that the prevalence of these crimes doesn't necessarily indicate a dangerous area, as they can often be opportunistic in nature.

Conversely, areas where crimes such as burglary and robbery are widespread may indeed be considered more dangerous. These types of crimes involve a higher level of intent and threat to individuals or property, suggesting a heightened level of risk in those areas.

By recognizing these distinctions in crime types and their implications, stakeholders can better understand the safety dynamics of different neighborhoods and implement targeted interventions to address specific challenges effectively.
